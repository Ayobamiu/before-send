# Send Check for Gmail Privacy Policy
Send Check for Gmail processes the text of your email draft in Gmail locally on your device to determine whether to show a warning (e.g., missing attachment or late-night sending).
We do not collect, store, sell, or transmit any personal data.
We do not send email content to any server.
No analytics, tracking, or third-party data sharing is used.
If you uninstall the extension, no data remains because none is stored.
